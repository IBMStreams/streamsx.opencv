Operators and Types
===================

All of the operators and types in this toolkit are defined in the Streams namespace ’com.ibm.streams.opencv’. To use them in an SPL application, include this statement at the top of your SPL or SPLMM source file:

        use com.ibm.streams.opencv::*;

The Streams types and operators in this toolkit are ’wrappers’ for C/C++ data structures, functions, and classes defined in the FFmpeg and OpenCV libraries.

For further information on the OpenCV API, please refer to the PDF files installed in /usr/local/share/OpenCV/doc and the [online OpenCV documentation](http://opencv.org/documentation.html).

For further information on the FFmpeg API, please refer to the ’ffmpeg’ man pages and the [online FFmpeg documentation](http://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html).

IplImage and BoxList types
--------------------------

All of the operators in this toolkit use the Streams type IplImage to represent video frames in tuples. It is defined like this:

        type IplImage = 
            int32 ipl_channels, 
            int32 ipl_depth, 
            int32 ipl_width, 
            int32 ipl_height, 
            list<uint8> ipl_data, 
            uint64 tag ;

The Streams type IplImage is a ’wrapper’ for the . Individual images representing video frames are held in the ’ipl\_data’ attribute of IplImage. The format of image data is described in the .

Some of the operators in this toolkit use the Streams type BoxList to represent rectangular areas within a video frame that are of particular interest. It is defined like this:

        type BoxList = 
            list<int32> x_list, 
            list<int32> y_list, 
            list<int32> width_list, 
            list<int32> height_list ;

An attribute of Streams type BoxList always appears in tuples along with an attribute of Streams type IplImage. The BoxList contains four integer lists that always have the same number of elements, representing the position and size of a rectangular subset of the video frame in the ’ipl\_data’ attribute of IplImage.

The `Crop` and `CropBoxes` operators can produce tuples of type IplImage or CroppedIplImage:

        type CroppedIplImage = 
            int32 ipl_channels, 
            int32 ipl_depth, 
            int32 ipl_width, 
            int32 ipl_height, 
            int32 ipl_x, 
            int32 ipl_y, 
            list<uint8> ipl_data, 
            uint64 tag ;

The attributes ’ipl\_x’ and ’ipl\_y’ of type CroppedIplImage are assigned the original position of the cropped image. That is, ’ipl\_x’ and ’ipl\_y’ are the ’x’ and ’y’ values the output image had in the input image.

AddText operator

CaptureFromCAM operator

CaptureFromURL operator

Obtain successive video frames from a HTTP server. The URL provided will be queried periodically to obtain the next frame. This is ideal to get video frames from an IP camera or a traffic camera. libCURL is used to retrieve the images. Please refer to libCURL documentation for the supported URL formats.

The format of the image fetched can be any format supported by OpenCV. This operator is not able to process web pages. The URL must be an image. The same URL is used to query successive frames and it is assumed that the image changes periodically on the server.

Input: none

Output:

Number of ports:

Tuple schema:  
IplImage

Punctuation:  
none

Parameters:

“url”:  
(required rstring) Location of image to poll periodically

“dieonerror”:  
(optional integer) Stop polling on error(1) or continue on errors(0), default 1

“format”:  
(optional rstring) Image format, default JPG

“rate”:  
(optional integer) Rate to poll the url, default 15

Used in these sample applications:

-   `box.spl`

-   `drawcontoursonurl.spl`

-   `url.spl`

CodeBook operator
-----------------

Compute the foreground/background segmentation of each frames using the CodeBook algorithm described in the book “Learning OpenCV”. This operator learns about the background for a period of time and builds a statistical model of each pixel. Once the learning phase ends, it uses the model to label each pixel of subsequence frames. A pixel belongs either to the forground or background. The result is a binary image where each pixel is either ’0’ (background) or ’255’ (foreground). Once the learning phase ends, the statistical models are not updated.

This algorithm is more powerful than a typical frame difference since the model built can accomodate periodic variation like water falls, tree leaves movement, etc. However during the learning phase, there must not be any foreground object in the field.

Input:

Number of ports:  
1

Tuple schema:  
IplImage

Output:

Number of ports:  
1

Tuple schema:  
IplImage, any additional attributes in the output tuple are assumed to be preserved from the input tuple

Punctuation:

Parameters:

“banner”:  
(optional integer) Produce an empty frame with the text “learning in progress” for each incoming frame during the learning phase (true-1, false-0), default 0

“time”:  
(optional integer) Learning time for image background in seconds (longer is better, so long as there are no foreground objects), default 10

Used in these sample applications:

-   `codebook.spl`

-   `demo4b.spl`

-   `demo4.spl`

-   `onc3.spl`

Collage operator
----------------

Assemble several video streams in a side by side fashion and produce a new video stream. Each video stream must be received on a different port. The height, depth and number of channels of the frame of each video stream must be identical. The frames are assembled from left to right. Each incoming video stream must be producing frames at the same rate. The operator will wait for a frame on each port before emitting a new composite frame.

CombineImg operator
-------------------

Overlay an image over another. The result image size is always the same as the size of the image on the first input port. The size of the second image may be bigger or smaller than the first image. The result is computed by computing the merge value of all the pixels overlapping between both images. The pixels from the second image that are outside the overlaping zone are ignored. The pixels of the first image that are not in the overlaping zone are unchanged. The opacity can be adjusted between 0 and 100 of the second image.

“depthAttribute”:  
(optional attribute) An input attribute containing the depth of the pixels, in bits. If not specified, the input attribute ’ipl\_depth’ is used, if present, otherwise the value ’8’ is assumed.

“channelsAttribute”:  
(optional attribute) An input attribute containing the number of color channels. If not specified, the input attribute ’ipl\_channels’ is used, if present, otherwise the value ’3’ is assumed.

“dataAttribute”:  
(optional attribute) An input attribute containing the pixel data. If not specified, the input type must contain an ’ipl\_data’ attribute. The attribute must be of type ’list\<uint8\>’. The size of the list must be width\*height\*channels.
