Sample Applications
===================

The sample applications in the toolkit illustrate how to use the operators. All of these applications are defined in the Streams namespace ’sample.OpenCV’, and use the operators and types in the namespace ’com.ibm.streams.opencv’;

The toolkit’s Makefile can build all of the sample applications, as shown in [Installing the OpenCV Toolkit](InstallingToolkit.html). The sample applications can also be built individually within Streams Studio, or with the ’sc’ command, like this:

        cd OpenCVToolkit/com.ibm.streams.opencv
        make sample_app_name_without_dot_spl
        ./output/sample_app_name_without_dot_spl/bin/standalone -d 1

Below are descriptions of each sample application, including which operators it uses.

addtext.spl
-----------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. Prints width, height, and frame count on the image. The resulting video is displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `AddText`

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `X11Viewer`

blank2.spl
----------

Creates a stream of blank images with a specific height, width, fps, and color. The stream stats are printed on the image. The resulting video is output to a HTTPViewer on a specific port.

toolkit operators used:

-   `Blank`

-   `HTTPViewer`

-   `Stats`

blank.spl
---------

Creates a stream of blank images with a specific height, width, fps, and color. The stream stats are printed on the image. The resulting video is output to a MJPEGStreamer on a specific port.

toolkit operators used:

-   `Blank`

-   `MJPEGStreamer`

-   `Stats`

box.spl
-------

Periodically polls for an image from a url. A box is added to the retrieved images. The resulting video is displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromURL`

-   `MakeBox`

-   `X11Viewer`

cam\_proxy.spl
--------------

Captures video from a local webcam. The resulting video is output through a proxy connection.

(See src\_proxy demo for the receiving proxy demo)

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromCAM`

-   `DisplayProxy`

cam.spl
-------

Captures video from a local webcam. The resulting video is displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromCAM`

-   `X11Viewer`

codebook.spl
------------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. The images are smoothed before background/foreground detection is done. For the first 1s, the background is “learned”, then only the foreground connected objects will be displayed in a X11 window.

The image from the CodeBook operator is a binary matrix of pixels of whether a foreground object is present(255) or not(0). This needed to be converted to a color image before the binary image was “ANDed” with the original image. This results in the foreground color image showing through and the background remaining black(0).

toolkit operators used:

-   `Apply2`

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `CodeBook`

-   `ConnectedComponents`

-   `CvtColor`

-   `Smooth`

-   `X11Viewer`

common.spl
----------

This is not a sample application, although it does have the .spl file extension.

This file is used to define all of the common tuple types, so the tuple definitions did not have to be included at the top of each sample application.

toolkit operators used: none

contours\_on\_file.spl
----------------------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. The images are converted to grey and smoothed before thresholding is done. All pixels with value 75 or less are changed to zero(black). Then white contours are drawn on the image.

In order to display the new image next to the original, they first have to have the same number of color channels. So the new image is converted to color first. The result is displayed in a X11 window and saved to an output file at the same frame rate as the input file.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `Collage`

-   `CvtColor`

-   `DrawContours`

-   `SaveToFile`

-   `Smooth`

-   `Threshold`

-   `X11Viewer`

contours\_on\_jpg.spl
---------------------

Then white contours are drawn on the image. The result is displayed in a X11 window. Then the stats <span>tuples/s, bytes/s, and number of seconds</span> are written to a log.

toolkit operators used:

-   `BitBucket`

-   `Blank`

-   `CvtColor`

-   `DrawContours`

-   `Smooth`

-   `SaveToFile`

-   `X11Viewer`

crawler.spl

demo1b.spl
----------

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromFile`

---------

demo2b.spl
----------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. Images are converted to grey scale and output to a MJPEGStreamer on a specific port.

Grey scale images are then passed through erode and dilate functions before outputing to a second MJPEGStreamer on a different port.

The original video is smoothed and outputted to a third MJPEGStreamer on a different port.

Using the original grey scale images, high and low thresholds are applied. The low value indicates pixels with a value less than are converted to black(0). The high value indicates pixels with larger values are converted to max(255) and less/equal are converted to black (0). Trackbars are used to allow the user to adjust the threshold values for the high and low thresholds. The two thresholded images are “ORed” together resulting in all “max” pixels being kept from the high threshold image and then all remaining pixels being kept from the low threshold image. The resulting video is output to a fourth MJPEGStreamer on a different port.

Using the eroded/dilated grey scale images, the same high and low thresholds as above are applied. The resulting video is output to a fifth MJPEGStreamer on a different port.

speed.spl
---------

A rough speed test. Creates a stream of 1000 blank images with a specific height, width, and color as fast as possible. The images are smoothed. Then the stats <span>tuples/s, bytes/s, and number of seconds</span> are written to a log.

toolkit operators used:

-   `BitBucket`

-   `Blank`

-   `Smooth`

src\_proxy.spl
--------------

Captures video through a proxy connection. The resulting video is displayed in a X11 window.

(See cam\_proxy demo for the transmitting proxy demo)

toolkit operators used:

-   `SourceProxy`

-   `X11Viewer`

threshold.spl
-------------

Captures video from a input file. Images are converted to grey scale. High and low thresholds are applied. The low value indicates pixels with a value less than are converted to black(0). The high value indicates pixels with larger values are converted to max(255) and less/equal are converted to black(0). Trackbars are used to allow the user to adjust the threshold values for the high and low thresholds. The two thresholded images are “ORed” together resulting in all “max” pixels being kept from the high threshold image and then all remaining pixels being kept from the low threshold image. The resulting video is displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `Apply2`

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `CvtColor`

-   `Threshold`

-   `TrackBar`

-   `X11Viewer`

url.spl
-------

Periodically polls for an image from a url. Images are displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromURL`

-   `X11Viewer`

video\_stream.spl
-----------------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. Images are output to a MJPEGStreamer on a specific port and output to a HTTPViewer on a specific port.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `HTTPViewer`

-   `MJPEGStreamer`

xcombine.spl
------------

Reads a stream of images from a video file. A second image is created by resizing the first to 130 with an offset and 30 second image does not overlap the first, the pixels are discarded. The result is displayed in a X11 window.

toolkit operators used:

-   `CaptureFromFile`

-   `CombineImg`

-   `Resize`

-   `X11Viewer`
