OpenCV Toolkit for IBM Streams
==============================

The OpenCV Toolkit for IBM Streams is a collection of operators for processing video streams.  The operators are built on many software libraries, primarily from these ’open source’ projects:

-   [OpenCV (Open Computer Vision)](http://opencv.org/)

-   [FFmpeg (Fast Forward MPEG)](http://ffmpeg.org/)

For instructions on obtaining and installing the toolkit and its dependencies, see [Installing the OpenCV Toolkit](InstallingToolkit.html).

For suggestions on getting started with the toolkit, see [Using the OpenCV Toolkit](UsingToolkit.html).
 
The operators in this toolkit enable Streams applications to:

-   ingest video streams from files, cameras, and web servers

-   select and transform individual frames from ingested video streams

-   display and store transformed video streams

The details of each operator are described in [Operators and Types](OperatorsAndTypes.html).

The toolkit also contains sample applications that illustrate the use of each operator, described in [Sample Applications](SampleApplications.html).
