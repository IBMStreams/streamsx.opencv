  "body": "### OpenCV toolkit for IBM Streams\r\n\r\nThe OpenCV toolkit for IBM Streams allows applications to ingest and process images with the [OpenCV (Open Computer Vision)](http://opencv.org/) library.\r\n\r\nThe toolkit includes step-by-step instructions for installing it, the OpenCV library, and their dependencies, and for verifying that they are working correctly by executing some of its sample applications. It also contains documentation for the toolkit's operators. For details, please see:\r\n\r\n- [Installing the Toolkit](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/com.ibm.streamsx.opencv/doc/html/InstallingToolkit.html)\r\n\r\n- [Using the Toolkit](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/com.ibm.streamsx.opencv/doc/html/UsingToolkit.html)\r\n\r\n- [Sample Applications](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/com.ibm.streamsx.opencv/doc/html/SampleApplications.html)\r\n\r\n- [Operators and Types](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/com.ibm.streamsx.opencv/doc/html/OperatorsAndTypes.html)\r\n\r\nFor information about the toolkit, please see [http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.opencv/).\r\n\r\nFor the toolkit's source code, please see [https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.opencv/](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.opencv/).\r\n\r\n",
